# FNB-CODE Repository

Welcome to my journey through the FNB App Academy 🚀  
This repository showcases all the projects and practice work I've built while learning full-stack development, structured by phases of progression.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- 1-Beginner-Phase/ — Foundational HTML, CSS, and beginner JavaScript projects  
- 2-Intermediate-Phase/ — In-progress intermediate projects with enhanced logic and UI  
- 3-Advanced-Phase/(Coming soon)* — Advanced applications and full-stack builds

Each phase contains subfolders for individual projects — from simple pages to interactive apps — all reflecting the skills, lessons, and creativity developed along the way.

## 💡 Purpose

This repo is more than just code — it’s a timeline of growth, problem-solving, and building real-world solutions. From voting accessibility to career tools, I aim to create tech that empowers people and communities.

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- PowerShell
- Visual Studio Code
- Responsive design practices
